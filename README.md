[✅] Game instance 
[✅] Basic physics : Vectors (2D), velocity and acceleration
[✅] Position based on camera
[✅] Keyboard control for one graphic element
[✅] Spriteset with multiple states
[✅] Detecting if elements are outside of screen, then ignore draw event
[✅] Collision detection
[ ] Fall blocking using collision logic
[ ] Zoom computing according to browser size

[ ] Defining areas with different physics (ice, water, trampolines)
[ ] Overriding collision behaviour depending on orientation
[ ] Collectible elements (coins)
[ ] Breakable elements based on collision, orientation and velocity
[ ] Graphic elements with basic AI
[ ] Version 1 🚀
